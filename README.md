# WebRTC

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication) is a set of standardized protocols and APIs that allow real-time communication between web browsers, mobile applications, and IoT devices. Originally developed by Google in 2011, WebRTC has since become a popular choice for real-time communication and streaming applications due to its low latency, high-quality audio and video, and ease of implementation.
